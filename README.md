`ideal` is a collection of tools used to generate client side assets, wrapped up in an easy to use CLI. It currently supports both `TypeScript` and `SASS`.

# Getting Started

To install `ideal`, run the following in the root of your project:

`yarn add {tbd}` or `npm install {tbd}`

# Basic Usage

`ideal` comes preconfigured to generate assets via a glob path, and outputs in a relative directory, `./dist`. This can be configured however with a contextual config file, outlined below.

To build your assets, run the following:

For `TypeScript`, run: `ideal build:js ./src/**/*.ts`  
For `Sass`, run: `ideal build:css ./src/styles.scss`

# Configuration
