ideal is a collection of pre-existing tools for generating client assets, wrapped up in a CLI. It currently supports `TypeScript` and `SASS`. The tools used are as follows:

- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) for compilation.

# Getting Started

Install with Yarn:

```
$ yarn add --dev @grpn/ideal
```

Install with NPM:

```
$ npm i --save-dev @grpn/ideal
```

TypeScript v3.8 is a `peerDependency` of ideal, so ensure you have it setup with a root [`tsconfig.json`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) and installed as a dependency of your project.

# Basic Usage

There are currently five "tasks" provided, `css`, `js`, `fonts`, `csproj` and `copy`. ideal uses a [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) path to target files, and outputs in a relative directory. This can be configured with a contextual config file, outlined below.

Try it out:

```
$ ideal js ./src/*.ts
$ ideal css ./src/*.scss
```

# Configuration

You can configure each build task via CLI arguments, or with an `ideal.config.js` file, located relative to where ideal is being run from.

## CLI Arguments

Arguments are passed to ideal via the following pattern: `--{key}={value}`. Where arguments are `boolean`, no value is required and their presence consistutes `true`.

## Options

See below for full list of configurable options. The column "_Usage_" indicates which method can be used to provide the option, as a `CLI` argument, a `Config` property, or `Both`

| Key             | Usage  | Value     | Default | About                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------ | --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| outputPath      | Both   | Path      | null    | A relative path to where you would like files to be written             |
| sourceDirectory | Both   | Path      | null    | A base directory to resolve all files from prior to sourcePath          |
| sourcePath      | Both   | Glob/Path | null    | The path to source files, this can also be provided as the 3rd argument |
| release         | Both   | N/A       | false   | Determine whether files are built for development or production         |
| sourceMap       | Both   | N/A       | false   | Output source maps to built assets                                      |
| cssModules      | Both   | N/A       | false   | Hash class names and build a json map file                              |
| watch           | Both   | N/A       | false   | Watch files for changes                                                 |
| watchPath       | Both   | Path      | null    | Path to where source files are being watched                            |
| verbose         | Both   | N/A       | false   | Output more info in the console                                         |
| pathAlias       | Both   | Path      | null    | Define a path alias for "@/" in webpack                                 |
| filePrefix      | Both   | String    | null    | Prepend this value to built assets, useful for versioning               |
| renameFile      | Config | Function  | null    | Rename output files, provides name and path (css + copy only)           |
| includePath     | Both   | Path(s)   | null    | Define source directory for file resolution, can be comma delimited     |
| skipManifest    | Both   | N/A       | false   | Exclude output files from being written to the manifest                 |
| manifestPath    | Both   | Path      | null    | Path where the manifest json file will be, default to "--outputPath"    |
| msbuildVersion  | Both   | String    | 15.0    | Version of MSBuild to use when building dotnet (msbuild only)           |
| msbuildPackage  | Both   | N/A       | false   | Package project when running MSBuild (msbuild only)                     |

## Config File

The structure of the `ideal.config.js` file can be seen below. Each top level property key matches a particular build task, e.g `css`.

```
module.exports = {
   css: {
      cssModules: true,
      watchPath: './src/**/*.scss',
      ...
   },
   js: {
      watchPath: './src/**/*.ts,
      ...
   }
};
```

This is then picked up at runtime by ideal. Each set of properties match their CLI equivelants, in value and casing.

### Webpack Specific

ideal allows you to manually specify a `webpack.config.js` file in the root directory of where ideal is being run from. If this file is found, it will override any default config provided by ideal. You can find the default settings used for [webpack here](https://github.groupondev.com/Coupons/ideal/blob/master/src/tasks/webpack/tools/webpack.default.ts)

If you need to define a path at _runtime_, you can set the following property, e.g:

```
window.__publicPath = '/cdn/path/';
```

### Fonts Specific

ideal uses meta data contained within the font files to generate a Base64 encoded string and `@font-face` block. If you're having issues with incorrect font families, make sure the meta data within the file (e.g `.woff`) is correct.

# Manifest

ideal creates an `assets.json` file in the output directory that keeps a record of all assets built _so far_. Each subsequent run of ideal appends each file name as a property with the hashed or _real_ file name as a value. Each build overides previous keys or declares new ones that don't yet exist. This file is intended to be ephermeral, e.g when running a production build with `--release`, this file should not exist in the output path. Equally the `assets.json` file should not be commited to your repository. This ensures that the file is an accurate reflection of the built files for the _currently_ provided source.

# Development

Once you've cloned this repo and run `yarn`, then `yarn start`, you can make use of [`npm link`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link.html) to simulate how this package will work when installed globally. From there, you can run the following in a directory of your choice to run a build:

```
$ ideal js ./path/to/stuff --watch
```
